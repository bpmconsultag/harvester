# Ansible Role: harvester

An Ansible role for managing SUSE Harvester HCI resources using the harvesterpy Python library.

## Description

This role provides Ansible modules to manage virtual machines, images, volumes, and networks in SUSE Harvester HCI. It wraps the harvesterpy Python library to offer idempotent, declarative infrastructure management through Ansible playbooks.

## Requirements

- Ansible 2.10 or higher
- Python 3.8 or higher
- harvesterpy Python library (see below for local development)
- Access to a SUSE Harvester HCI cluster

## Installation

### From Ansible Galaxy (when published)


```bash
ansible-galaxy install bpmconsultag.harvester
```

### From Source



```bash
git clone https://github.com/bpmconsultag/harvester.git
cd harvester
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

Or reference the role directly in your playbook from the repository.

## Using the Local harvesterpy Library for Development

If you are developing or testing with the local harvesterpy source (not the PyPI package), you must install it into your Python environment:

From the root of the repository:

```bash
cd /path/to/harvesterpy  # project root containing setup.py or pyproject.toml
pip install -e .
```

Alternatively, you can set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable before running Ansible:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PYTHONPATH
```
This should be run from the project root.

If you see errors about the harvesterpy library not being found, ensure you have performed one of the above steps in the same environment where Ansible runs.

## Example Playbooks in Repository


## Running Example Playbooks


When running the example playbooks, you must specify the custom module path so Ansible can find the harvester modules:

```sh
# If you are in the ansible/roles/harvesterpy directory:
ansible-playbook -i examples/inventory.ini examples/create_vm.yml --module-path=library -e "harvester_verify_ssl=false"

# Or from the project root:
ansible-playbook -i ansible/roles/harvesterpy/examples/inventory.ini ansible/roles/harvesterpy/examples/create_vm.yml --module-path=ansible/roles/harvesterpy/library -e "harvester_verify_ssl=false"
```

This ensures Ansible loads the modules from the `library/` directory in this role. If you see errors like `couldn't resolve module/action 'harvester_image'`, make sure to use the `--module-path` option as shown above.

The role includes several example playbooks in the `examples/` directory:

- `create_vm.yml`: Complete VM creation with image and volume
- `manage_vm_lifecycle.yml`: Start, stop, and restart operations
- `cleanup.yml`: Remove all created resources
- `inventory.ini`: Example inventory file

## Best Practices

1. **Use Ansible Vault for Credentials**: Store sensitive information like tokens and passwords in Ansible Vault:
   ```bash
   ansible-vault create group_vars/all/vault.yml
   ```

2. **Idempotency**: All modules are idempotent. Running the same playbook multiple times will not create duplicate resources.

3. **Check Mode**: All modules support Ansible's check mode (`--check`) for dry runs.

4. **Tags**: Use tags to organize your playbooks:
   ```yaml
   - name: Create VM
     harvester_vm:
       # ...
     tags: [harvester, vm, create]
   ```

5. **Error Handling**: Use `ignore_errors` and `failed_when` for better error handling:
   ```yaml
   - name: Delete VM (may not exist)
     harvester_vm:
       name: "my-vm"
       state: absent
     ignore_errors: true
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Module not found

If Ansible cannot find the modules, ensure the role is properly installed and the library path is correct:

```bash
export ANSIBLE_LIBRARY=/path/to/harvesterpy/ansible/roles/harvesterpy/library:$ANSIBLE_LIBRARY
```

### harvesterpy not installed


If you encounter issues with the harvesterpy library not being found, ensure you have installed it as described above. For production or non-development use, you can install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install harvesterpy
```

### SSL Certificate Verification

If you're using self-signed certificates, you can disable SSL verification (not recommended for production):

```yaml
harvester_verify_ssl: false
```

## Testing

To test the role locally:

1. Set up your Harvester connection details in a vars file
2. Run the example playbooks:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i examples/inventory.ini examples/create_vm.yml
   ```
